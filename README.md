Hello everyone! 👋

I am Manon, a junior front-end developer, based in Paris, France.
Absolutely passionate and fascinated by foreign languages, I realized it was about time to learn some more "exotic" languages… Such as JavaScript! 😉 
I am excited to be going on a new professional adventure in the web development after having taught French and English in Australia, Japan and France.
I have a passion for learning new things and changing my horizon.
